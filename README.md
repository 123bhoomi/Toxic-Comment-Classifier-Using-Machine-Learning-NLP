# Toxic-Comment-Classifier-Using-Machine-Learning-NLP
Built a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify toxic online comments (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats) using natural language processing techniques. Preprocessed text data, applied feature extraction (TF-IDF/word embeddings), and trained classification models to improve moderation and ensure safer online interactions.
